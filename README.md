RENDER is an agent-based ene**R**gy d**E**ma**N**d mo**D**eling fram**E**wo**R**k. It is developed based on two open-source packages: 

- `Melodie`, which is an open-source general framework for agent-based modeling in Python;
- `tab2dict`, which is designed to support data management in model development, especially for developing agent-based models. 

We aim to develop a series of energy demand models with the RENDER framework. At the moment, RENDER-Building is finished and published in this repo. Further details will be added.
