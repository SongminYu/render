# Introduction

`RENDER` is an agent-based ene**R**gy d**E**ma**N**d mo**D**eling fram**E**wo**R**k developed based on two open-source packages: 

- `Melodie`, an open-source general framework for agent-based modeling in Python ([repo](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/Melodie));
- `tab2dict`, a data management tool designed for developing scientific models, especially for agent-based models ([repo](https://github.com/SongminYu/tab2dict)). 

By using `RENDER`, we aim to develop a series of energy demand models, among which the RENDER-Building model is the first one developed in the RokiG project under the xxx program.
