# RenderNew

This is a new repo for the RENDER models based on `Melodie V1.0.1` and `tab2dict`.

### Todos
 - fill in data for serial renovation --> `id_building_action = 3`
 - update energy carrier related scenario table
 - fill in the values for all `cooling` and `ventilation` tables.
 - develop region- and year-specific weather data.
 - Technically, we can also distribute location-level results to hector-level, based on the GHSL data.
