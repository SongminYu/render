# Model Calibration

> We first prepare all the data and setup the model logic and scenarios 2010-2022, 
> then we start calibrating the model systematically.

## Prepare data

- [ ] NUTS3 weather data (Hannah): temperature, radiation, pv generation (2010-2022). For years up to 2050, temperature scenarios are also needed
- [ ] energy balance data at both region and country levels (2010-2022) (Weijia)
- [ ] energy carrier price tables

## Extract model indicators

- [ ] extract the factor between `heating_demand_norm` and `heating_demand` for comparing with literature --> data can be extracted from reports

## Visualization
- [ ] dashboard (more or less ready) or pivot tables in Excel (can be created)
- [ ] plot history deviation by end-use and energy carrier
