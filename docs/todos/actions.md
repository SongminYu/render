### Meeting

* How about the server use?
* Does the new scaling logic produce similar final energy demand result? We can try 9010101 quickly. If so, we can 
  * merge the branch to main
  * remove the two min and max parameters from scenario.
  * send building stock data to Nico
* Updates on the designing of building demolition and construction
* Updates on meetings with Hannah and Weijia
* Discussion on the open points
  * Regarding population...
    * What data do we have regarding "population/employee", at what geo-level (e.g., region, location, etc.)?  
    * Should the residential and non-residential population roughly equal to each other? We can check.
    * We should first organize this, if necessary, update unit user logic, then continue with building construction logic.
  * Regarding 2019 takes longer...
    * Many building components are renovated or demolished in 2019. 
    * We need to find a way to smooth this.
* Plan next meetings
