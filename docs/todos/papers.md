# Papers

## RENDER-Building paper

* model introduction (paper-to-cite)
* cite eceee data paper
* cite eceee RokiG scenarios paper

## HP + gas operation paper

* the results can be used to introduce a new option for the "technology_main" in RENDER-Building

## HP potential papers

### HP potential for EU

* develop HP potential for EU by considering the space between buildings 
* For Germany, process the data by NUTS3 and settlement types, so we can use it in RENDER
	
### HP and DH competition in Germany

* Model the competition between HP and DH with the consideration of the availability of them
* Also consider DH supply scenarios

## RokiG papers with Nico

### Renewable expansion and required renovation roadmap

* Input ISI:
  * building stock data
    * Discuission about how to aggregate them (aggregation is done by EBC)
  * Yearly or Hourly electricity emission factors and prices for several pathways/scenarios

* Calculation EBC 
  * Clustering of building types 
  * Output: Building archetypes, weights and buildings that they are representing 
  * Optimimzation of each building individually to achieve an emission target in 2030 and 2045 in different scenarios

### Combining optimization and simulation methodologies

* ISI:
  * Same Inputs as before
  * After receiving optimized results: forecast under different policy measures for different groups of buildings

* EBC:
  * Building stock optimization for building archetypes to reach stock emission targets under limited capacities 
    * Decisions only in five year steps or more
