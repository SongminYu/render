# Logic development

## Investment decisions

### heating system

- [ ] diffusion of second-technology?

### renovation

- [ ] Possibility to apply the non-renovation probability at building level (so, before iterating through components)
- [ ] limit the probability of lifecycle renovation being triggered (maybe too high now)

### both

- [ ] capex calculation: payback time is not lifetime but other values (similar perspective but different calculation: the pay in the first year might influence the decision)
- [ ] impact of unit user properties: income group, age group
- [ ] endogenous price change of heating technology, biomass, etc. due to demand change
- [ ] consider willingness-to-pay: as the on-top money that may change the order of the options in the last step

## Heating system

- [ ] more detailed modeling of combined technologies, e.g., HP + gas as an option for the "main technology"
- [ ] contribution factor depends on the type of main heating technology and building efficiency class?
- [ ] use better COP of HP to show the impact of smart management (in general, use results of optimization model as input parameters for the RENDER-Building model, to reflect prosumaging / SEMS scenarios)

## Heating demand
